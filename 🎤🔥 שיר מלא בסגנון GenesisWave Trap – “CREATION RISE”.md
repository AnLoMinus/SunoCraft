# 🎶🔥 **CREATION RISE – FULL GENESISWAVE SONG**

*Epic Afro–Electro–Trap • Holy Energy • Cosmic Storytelling*
*בתים ארוכים • פזמונים מלאים • גשרים • פאנצ'ים 🔥⚡*

---

# 🌅 **Intro – “Before the Spark”**

🌌 Whisper FX • cosmic wind • low heartbeat • light glow
**Rap Whisper:**
*"Before anything was written, before the void had a name,
I stood in the shadow of silence — ready to ignite the flame."*

---

# 🎤 **Verse 1 – “Break the Darkness”**

🔥
I step into the void, letting destiny breathe,
Cosmic winds in my chest, holy fire beneath.
Every step that I climb rewrites the fate I receive,
Creation in my palms — watch the forces conceive.

⚡
Electric pads hum softly like a prophecy call,
Drums hit heavy like thunder through a temple hall.
I rise from the dust — never choosing to fall,
Light breaks in my veins — I'm answering the call.

---

# 🎶 **Pre-Chorus – “First Light Rising”**

✨
Heaven trembles when the spark starts to grow,
Waves of creation in a Genesis flow.
Shadow melts slowly where the holy beams glow,
I inhale the divine — and exhale what I know.

---

# 🌟 **Chorus – “Let There Be Light”**

🎵
Let there be light — let it tear through the night,
Let my heartbeat align with the forces of might.
SparKing in my soul — radiating so bright,
AnLoMinus rising — creation taking flight.

---

# 🔥 **Verse 2 – “Story of the Sparks”**

🌀
I’m the echo of existence, the spark in the code,
I’m the voice of the flame in a cosmic-mode.
Every bar that I drop is a world that explodes,
Every rhyme that I carve is a pathway bestowed.

🎤
Angelic choirs hover over violin stabs,
Sax lines glow warm through the rhythmic jabs.
I channel ancient fire through the words I grab,
A warrior of light — no defeat in my lab.

---

# 🎶 **Bridge – “Waves of Awakening”**

🌊
Let the waves rise higher — let the world be reborn,
Let the shadows retreat from the rhythm I’ve sworn.
Holy winds circle me like a celestial horn,
I am light in the storm — a creation un-torn.

---

# ⚡ **Chorus 2 – “Awakening Fire”**

🔥
Awaken the fire — let it burn through the past,
Break every boundary — nothing holding me fast.
I ascend through dimensions — rising so vast,
In the rhythm of creation — my crown is cast.

---

# 🗡️ **Verse 3 – “Power of the Beginning”**

♨️
I tear through illusions like a cosmic blade,
Every lie that held me down — slowly starts to fade.
I don’t follow the darkness — I was never afraid,
I'm a king of new creation — perfectly made.

⚡
Reverse echoes swirl as the prophecy bends,
Trap drums strike hard as the heartbeat ascends.
I rewrite the horizon — the old world ends,
A new spark forms — and the universe extends.

---

# 🌅 **Outro – “Bereshit Within Me”**

✨
*"Inside every breath… a new world forms."*
*"Inside every beat… a new light swarms."*
*"Inside every spark… destiny warms."*
*"Inside every rhyme — creation performs."*

---

# 🎤🔥 **פאנצ׳ים לסיום (4 שורות ראפ):**

⚡
I carve the light in bars, let the cosmos align,
SparKing in my pulse — every breath is divine.
Leon Yaakobov rising — universe redesign,
Creation in my voice — holy power in rhyme.
